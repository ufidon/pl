# Goals of Programming Languages

- Programming languages aim to balance three key goals:
  - **Productivity**: Easier, faster development (e.g., Python, Haskell, C#, F#)
  - **Safety**: Prevent errors and ensure correctness (e.g., Java, Rust)
  - **Performance**: Maximize speed and efficiency (e.g., C, Rust)
- Different designs prioritize these goals in unique ways, leading to diverse ecosystems.

---

## Software Complexity and Challenges
- **Complex ecosystems**:  
  - From individual languages to entire systems.
- **Developers spend more time reading code than writing it.**
  - Studies show that program comprehension dominates development time.
  - Developers primarily focus on understanding and debugging, not writing.
- **Hardware advances are outpacing software adaptation.**
  - Significant gaps in performance utilization exist.
- **Memory usage has exploded.**
  - Applications demand more resources than ever before.
- **Bugs remain a persistent issue.**
  - Bugs and inefficiencies are stubborn problems.
    - Memory-related vulnerabilities are still a leading cause of security flaws.

# The Big Picture of Programming Languages

- **Pioneers in Computing:**
  - Alan Turing: 
    - The `Turing Machine`: a sequential state-based model of computation.
    - `Turing` Languages
  - Alonzo Church: 
    - [Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory): a functional, mathematical abstraction of computation.
    - `Church` Languages
- Programming languages have been shaped by visionary ideas:
  - Grace Hopper: Early automation and abstraction
  - John Backus: Efficiency through compilers (FORTRAN)
  - Kristen Nygaard: Object-oriented programming (Simula)

## [Programming paradigms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm)

| **Paradigm**   | **Description**    | **Key Features** | **Examples**  | **Applications**     |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **Imperative**         | Focuses on describing *how* a program operates through step-by-step instructions.                       | Mutable state, loops, conditionals, sequential execution.                       | C, Python, Java           | System programming, general-purpose. |
