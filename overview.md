# Goals of Programming Languages

- Programming languages aim to balance three key goals:
  - **Productivity**: Easier, faster development (e.g., Python, Haskell, C#, F#)
  - **Safety**: Prevent errors and ensure correctness (e.g., Java, Rust)
  - **Performance**: Maximize speed and efficiency (e.g., C, Rust)
- Different designs prioritize these goals in unique ways, leading to diverse ecosystems.

---

## Software Complexity and Challenges
- **Complex ecosystems**:  
  - From individual languages to entire systems.
- **Developers spend more time reading code than writing it.**
  - Studies show that program comprehension dominates development time.
  - Developers primarily focus on understanding and debugging, not writing.
- **Hardware advances are outpacing software adaptation.**
  - Significant gaps in performance utilization exist.
- **Memory usage has exploded.**
  - Applications demand more resources than ever before.
- **Bugs remain a persistent issue.**
  - Bugs and inefficiencies are stubborn problems.
    - Memory-related vulnerabilities are still a leading cause of security flaws.

# The Big Picture of Programming Languages

- **Pioneers in Computing:**
  - Alan Turing: 
    - The `Turing Machine`: a sequential state-based model of computation.
    - `Turing` Languages
  - Alonzo Church: 
    - [Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory): a functional, mathematical abstraction of computation.
    - `Church` Languages
- Computability: `Turing Completeness`
  - Both paradigms are Turing-complete, meaning any computation expressible in one can be expressed in the other.
  - A Turing Machine can simulate lambda calculus and vice versa.

| **Execution Model**| Sequence of instructions, often manipulating a global state. | Function application, substitution, and evaluation. |
| **Paradigm**       | Imperative      | Functional      |
| **Strengths**   | Performance, hardware-level control    | Simplicity, mathematical rigor    |
| **Weaknesses**   | Complexity in state management   | Less intuitive for sequential operations|
| **Use Cases**    | System programming, general software   | Academic research, parallel computing   |
